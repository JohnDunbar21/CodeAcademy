# Review of Generics

In this folder, we have covered:

* How generics help us make scalable code.
* How the diamond operator (`<>`) is used to define generic classes, interfaces, or methods.
* How generics provide compile-time type safety and bug detection as opposed to raw types.
* How we can create multiiple bound generic classes, interfaces, and methods.
* How wildcards are used to define unknown types.
* How to add upper bounds to type parameters and wildcards.
* How to add lower bounds to wildcards.
