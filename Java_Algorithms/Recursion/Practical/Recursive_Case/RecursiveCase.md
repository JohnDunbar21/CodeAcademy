# Recursive Case

In the last exercise, you created a condition (`n > 0` or `n >= 1`). This condition is important, because it defines whether or not `recursiveFactorial()` calls itself. We call this `if` block the **recursive case**.

In recursion, the **recursive case** is the condition under which a method calls itself. We call this the recursive case because, as mentioned in the last exercise, recursion is defined as: a process that includes a method calling itself.
