# Introduction

Recursion is a powerful tool for solving problems that require the execution of an action multiple times until a condition is met. For many problems, a recursive solution will result in fewer lines of code and will be easier to comprehend than a solution that uses a `for` or `while` loop.

Letâ€™s consider `4` factorial:

`4! = 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 24`

Four factorial is equal to the product of `4 x 3 x 2 x 1`, which is `24`. The exclamation mark denotes that the number `4` is being factorialized.

`1!` and `0!` are both valid base cases of factorial. The factorial product of both numbers is 1.
